Alice & Eve aims to bring together talents in the field of computing. The third edition of this workshop will be hosted
on **18 November 2022** by the Delft University of Technology.

Alice and Eve event is inspired by the [BCS Lovelace Colloquium](https://bcswomenlovelace.bcs.org/) that started in 2008. For more details about earlier editions of Alice & Eve, see the websites of [2021](https://aliceandeve.cs.ru.nl/)
and [2020](https://fmt.ewi.utwente.nl/events/aliceandeve2020/).

The event is held during a single day, and features:

- keynote talks,
- a poster contest, and
- an exhibition on women in computing.

Join us, and participate to our poster contest on the topic of your choice!

### Venue:

The workshop will be held at [Mondai House of AI @ Next Delft](https://mondai.tudelftcampus.nl/en/) at the TU Delft
campus.

### Registration:

The registration is free and includes coffee breaks, lunch and drinks. We welcome everyone of **all genders**, **from
bachelor students to full professors**, to attend the event.

- **Ada Lovelace** who is known for her work on the design of the ‘Analytics Machine’, the first ever general-purpose
  computer, and the first published algorithm;
- **Rosalind Picard** and her work on Affective Computing which is a combination of Computer Science, Psychology,
  Physiology and Cognitive Sciences;
- **Frances Brazier** who helped establish the first Internet Service Provider (ISP) in the Netherlands and Europe.

More information on these women, and many others, can be found at the exhibition and
the [online booklet](https://fmt.ewi.utwente.nl/events/aliceandeve2020/booklet-13-01-2020.pdf).

Stefanie Roos is an Assistant Professor at TU Delft, she works on decentralization with a focus on privacy-enhancing technologies and security. She has worked on censorship-resistant publication systems like Freenet, anonymous communication networks like Tor, and improved the scalability of blockchains.
</div>
</div>

**Talk: Resilient Publication in the Face of State Censorship**  
Internet censorship is wide-spread and plays a key role during protests, e.g., as the ones currently ongoing in Iran. In
this talk , I will first give an overview of different scenarios for censorship and methods for circumvention. I will
then discuss peer-to-peer-based approaches for publishing information in a censorship-resistant manner in more detail.
In contrast to most state-of-the-art censorship-resistance systems, such approaches remain applicable if a country
completely disconnects their national internet from the global internet.

<div class="invited-bio" style="">
Judith Good is Professor of Human Computer Interaction in the Informatics Institute at the University of Amsterdam, and director of the newly founded Digital Interactions Lab. She has degrees in psychology and artificial intelligence, and has worked at universities in both Europe and the United States. Her overarching research aim is to develop impactful technologies, designed with end users from the outset, which can have a transformative and empowering effect on the people who use them. Within this broad area, she has focussed on better understanding how people learn, and on how innovative technologies can best support their learning. She is particularly interested in working with people with disabilities, particularly autism, to design technologies which improve their lived experiences. Judith was also actively involved in a number of initiatives to support women and girls in STEM subjects whilst in the UK, and is continuing this work in the Netherlands.
</div>
</div>

**Talk: Towards a more inclusive digital society**  
Much of the research in human computer interaction takes the form of finding a solution to a ‘problem’, typically by
designing a new technology that can solve this problem, or at least go some way towards addressing it. The implicit
assumption is that the worse the problem, the more any solution, and hence the research contribution, will be noteworthy
and important. This creates tensions when designing for disability, with target users and/or their characteristics,
often being framed as somehow problematic. This, in turn, leads to “solutions” which are not fit for purpose. In this
talk, I will consider how we might take a different approach to technology design for disability, with the aim of
leading to positive changes in what/how/why we design.

**Talk: Enhancing the Understanding and Prediction of Software Delays at ING Using Machine Learning**  
In today’s rapidly changing world, the ability to be agile as well as predictable is essential to modern software
development companies. To become more predictable in software deliveries, it is essential to better understand which
factors affect the on-time delivery of software. We performed several large-scale case studies at ING to investigate
which social and technical factors affect the on-time delivery of software, how they interact with each other and how
their effects change over time. We have successfully integrated these influential factors using incremental learning for
delay prediction at ING. Our results indicate that the planning of software can be significantly improved by
incorporating team/process-related information and dynamic methods into analysis/predictive models.

**Talk: Experiences in Systems Research with Impact.**  
The task of defining a research track with original contributions and impact can appear daunting, due to the many possible choices of direction that one can make, but also the increasing maturity of the field of computing, its growth and the increased sense of competition that comes with that. The systems side of computer science, where I am active, has very many direct applications outside academia, and my personal preference has been to select topics and direction that can make an impact there.  This talk will be structured around my personal experiences in the area of data systems research in the past decades. I will share some of my viewpoints on fundamental vs. applied research, trends in research practice that can diminish the impact of research, and strategies to make research more impactful, including community building, communication, open-source and spin-offs; and hope to discuss these with the audience as well.

**Talk: Predictive Maintenance.**  
No more train delays. The grand vision of Predictive Maintenance (PdM) using data analytics to predict potential failures so well, so these can be prevented by performing maintenance exactly when and where needed --- thus resulting in switches, signaling systems and signals experiencing no zero downtime.
 
While predictive maintenance has its roots in mechanical and civil engineering, I will
in this talk elaborate on how computer science lies at the heart of many challenges in predictive maintenance, especially when it comes to automation of the solutions, their specification and verification, multi-stage optimization, the complexity of IT architecture, as well as the organizational objectding of the solutions. Thus, I hope to inspire the audience to contribute to this beautiful, relevant and exciting field.

**Talk: Reasoning about games vs programs.**  
Software systems are built from many interacting components, and analyzing whether a component behaves correctly cannot be done without considering the behavior of the other components. In formal verification, the approach taken to analyze such systems is often game-theoretic. Game logic, introduced by Parikh in 1983, provides a formal framework for reasoning about what agents can achieve in interactions that can be modelled as determined 2-player games. Despite being introduced almost 40 years ago, and in contrast with the situation for the closely related program logic PDL, several fundamental questions about game logic have only recently been answered or remain open. In this talk, I will survey some of these results and open questions.
